# Monte Carlo Estimation of Intersection Volume

This project estimates the volume of the intersection of a rectangular box, a cylinder, and a square pyramid using the Monte Carlo method with a parallel computing approach.


## Introduction

The objective of this project is to estimate the volume of the intersection of three geometric shapes: a rectangular box, a cylinder, and a square pyramid. Analytical solutions for this problem are complex and often infeasible. Therefore, we use the Monte Carlo method, which provides an approximate but efficient solution through random sampling.

## Problem Description

We have three shapes in 3D space:
1. A rectangular box defined by its eight vertices.
2. A cylinder defined by the center points of its top and bottom faces and its radius.
3. A square pyramid defined by its five vertices.

The goal is to estimate the volume of the region where all three shapes intersect.

## Monte Carlo Method

The Monte Carlo method is a statistical approach that uses random sampling to estimate a result. Hereâ€™s how it works for our problem:
1. We define a bounding box that encompasses all three shapes.
2. We generate a large number of random points within this bounding box.
3. For each point, we check if it lies within all three shapes.
4. We calculate the proportion of points that fall within the intersection.
5. Finally, we estimate the volume of the intersection based on this proportion.

## Parallel Computing

To speed up the computation, we use parallel computing. This involves distributing the workload across multiple processors. In our implementation, we use Python's `multiprocessing` module to parallelize the point-in-shape checks. This significantly reduces the computation time, especially when dealing with a large number of random points.

## Code Implementation

### Importing Libraries

```python
import numpy as np
from multiprocessing import Pool
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d.art3d import Poly3DCollection
```

- **numpy (`np`)**: A library for numerical computations.
- **multiprocessing (`Pool`)**: A module to create a pool of worker processes for parallel execution.
- **matplotlib.pyplot (`plt`)**: A plotting library to create visualizations.

### Defining the Shapes

#### Function: `is_inside_box`

```python
def is_inside_box(point, vertices):
    min_x = min(vertices[:, 0])
    max_x = max(vertices[:, 0])
    min_y = min(vertices[:, 1])
    max_y = max(vertices[:, 1])
    min_z = min(vertices[:, 2])
    max_z = max(vertices[:, 2])

- **Explanation**: Calculate the minimum and maximum coordinates of the box and check if the point lies within these bounds.

#### Function: `is_inside_cylinder`

```python
def is_inside_cylinder(point, c1, c2, radius):
    height_vector = c2 - c1
    height = np.linalg.norm(height_vector)
    axis = height_vector / height
    projection = np.dot(point - c1, axis)

    if projection < 0 or projection > height:
        return False

    perpendicular_vector = point - (c1 + projection * axis)
    distance = np.linalg.norm(perpendicular_vector)

    return distance <= radius
```

- **Purpose**: Check if a point is inside a cylinder.
- **Input**: `point` (a 3D point), `c1` and `c2` (center points of the cylinder's top and bottom faces), `radius` (radius of the cylinder).

    if point[2] > apex[2]:
        return False

    def point_in_triangle(pt, v1, v2, v3):
        v1 = np.array(v1)
        v2 = np.array(v2)
        v3 = np.array(v3)
        pt = np.array(pt)
        v1v2 = v2 - v1
        v1v3 = v3 - v1
        v1p = pt - v1
        dot11 = np.dot(v1v2, v1v2)

        dot33 = np.dot(v1v3, v1v3)
        dot1p = np.dot(v1v2, v1p)
        dot3p = np.dot(v1v3, v1p)
        invDenom = 1 / (dot11 * dot33 - dot13 * dot13)
        u = (dot33 * dot1p - dot13 * dot3p) * invDenom
        v = (dot11 * dot3p - dot13 * dot1p) * invDenom
        return (u >= 0) and (v >= 0) and (u + v < 1)

    return (point_in_triangle(point[:2], base_vertices[0][:2], base_vertices[1][:2], base_vertices[2][:2]) or
            point_in_triangle(point[:2], base_vertices[0][:2], base_vertices[2][:2], base_vertices[3][:2]))
```

- **Purpose**: Check if a point is inside a square pyramid.
- **Input**: `point` (a 3D point), `vertices` (an array of the pyramid's vertices).
- **Output**: `True` if the point is inside the pyramid, `False` otherwise.
